"git" is a VCS for tracking individual line changes across files

a "repository"  or "repo" is a regular file that has been told to work with git

"git init" is a command we run one time per project to tell a  folder that we're going to use git to track changes

"git status" shows you what files are tracked, what if anything has changed
